"""
YouTube Summarizer FastAPI Application
=====================================

This FastAPI application provides a comprehensive API for YouTube video processing,
including scraping, transcription, and AI-powered summarization.

## üîÑ Processing Workflow

The application uses a multi-tier fallback approach for optimal results:

### Tier 1: Apify YouTube Scraper API
- Uses professional YouTube scraping API to extract video metadata and transcripts
- Fastest and most reliable method when API quota is available
- Supports automatic transcript extraction and chapter detection

### Tier 2: Gemini Direct Processing
- Directly processes YouTube URLs using Google's Gemini AI
- Fallback when API fails or quota is exhausted
- Provides analysis even for problematic videos

## üìä API Endpoints

- `/validate-url` - Validate YouTube URLs
- `/video-info` - Extract video metadata
- `/transcript` - Get video transcripts
- `/summary` - Generate text summaries
- `/process` - Complete processing pipeline
- `/generate` - Master endpoint with all capabilities

## üîß Configuration

Set environment variables:
- `APIFY_API_KEY` - For YouTube scraping API
- `GEMINI_API_KEY` - For AI summarization
- `FAL_KEY` - For audio transcription (legacy fallback)
- `PORT` - Server port (default: 8080)
- `HOST` - Server host (default: 0.0.0.0)

Backend-only package for programmatic use and frontend integration.

    # Example transcript
    example_transcript = """- This single equation spawned four multi-trillion dollar industries and transformed everyone's approach to risk. Do you think that most people are aware of the size, scale, utility of derivatives? - No. No idea. - But at its core, this equation comes from physics, from discovering atoms, understanding how heat is transferred, and how to beat the casino at blackjack. So maybe it shouldn't be surprising that some of the best to beat the stock market were not veteran traders, but physicists, scientists, and mathematicians. In 1988, a mathematics professor named Jim Simons set up the Medallion Investment Fund, and every year for the next 30 years, the Medallion fund delivered higher returns than the market average, and not just by a little bit, it returned 66% per year. At that rate of growth, $100 invested in 1988 would be worth $8.4 billion today. This made Jim Simons easily the richest mathematician of all time. But being good at math doesn't guarantee success in financial markets. Just ask Isaac Newton. In 1720 Newton was 77 years old, and he was rich. He had made a lot of money working as a professor at Cambridge for decades, and he had a side hustle as the Master of the Royal Mint. His net worth was ¬£30,000 the equivalent of $6 million today. Now, to grow his fortune, Newton invested in stocks. One of his big bets was on the South Sea Company. Their business was shipping enslaved Africans across the Atlantic. Business was booming and the share price grew rapidly. By April of 1720, the value of Newton's shares had doubled. So he sold his stock. But the stock price kept going up and by June, Newton bought back in and he kept buying shares even as the price peaked. When the price started to fall, Newton didn't sell. He bought more shares thinking he was buying the dip. But there was no rebound, and ultimately he lost around a third of his wealth. When asked why he didn't see it coming, Newton responded, \"I can calculate the motions of the heavenly bodies, but not the madness of people.\" So what did Simons get right that Newton got wrong? Well, for one thing, Simons was able to stand on the shoulders of giants. The pioneer of using math to model financial markets was Louis Bachelier, born in 1870. Both of his parents died when he was 18 and he had to take over his father's wine business. He sold the business a few years later and moved to Paris to study physics, but he needed a job to support himself and his family and he found one at the Bourse, The Paris Stock Exchange. And inside was Newton's \"madness of people\" in its rawest form. Hundreds of traders screaming prices, making hand signals, and doing deals. The thing that captured Bachelier's interest were contracts known as options. The earliest known options were bought around 600 BC by the Greek philosopher Thales of Miletus. He believed that the coming summer would yield a bumper crop of olives. To make money off this idea, he could have purchased olive presses, which if you were right, would be in great demand, but he didn't have enough money to buy the machines. So instead he went to all the existing olive press owners and paid them a little bit of money to secure the option to rent their presses in the summer for a specified price. When the harvest came, Thales was right, there were so many olives that the price of renting a press skyrocketed. Thales paid the press owners their pre-agreed price, and then he rented out the machines at a higher rate and pocketed the difference. Thales had executed the first known call option. A call option gives you the right, but not the obligation to buy something at a later date for a set price known as the strike price. You can also buy a put option, which gives you the right, but not the obligation to sell something at a later date for the strike price. Put options are useful if you expect the price to go down. Call options are useful if you expect the price to go up. For example, let's say the current price of Apple stock is a hundred dollars, but you expect it to go up. You could buy a call option for $10 that gives you the right, but not the obligation to buy Apple stock in one year for a hundred dollars. That is the strike price. Just a little side note, American options can be exercised on any date up to the expiry, whereas European options must be exercised on the expiry date. To keep things simple, we'll stick to European options. So if in a year the price of Apple stock has gone up to $130, you can use the option to buy shares for a hundred dollars and then immediately sell them for $130. After you take into account the $10 you paid for the option, you've made a $20 profit. Alternatively, if in a year the stock prices dropped to $70, you just wouldn't use the option and you've lost the $10 you paid for it. So the profit and loss diagram looks like this. If the stock price ends up below the strike price, you lose what you paid for the option. But if the stock price is higher than the strike price, then you earn that difference minus the cost of the option. There are at least three advantages of options. One is that it limits your downside. If you had bought the stock instead of the option and it went down to $70, you would've lost $30. And in theory, you could have lost a hundred if the stock went to zero. The second benefit is options provide leverage. If you had bought the stock and it went up to $130, then your investment grew by 30%. But if you had bought the option, you only had to put up $10. So your profit of $20 is actually a 200% return on investment. On the downside, if you had owned the stock, your investment would've only dropped by 30%, whereas with the option you lose all 100%. So with options trading, there's a chance to make much larger profits, but also much bigger losses. The third benefit is you can use options as a hedge. - I think the original motivation for options was to figure out a way to reduce risk. And then of course, once people decided they wanted to buy insurance, that meant that there are other people out there that wanted to sell it or a profit, and that's how markets get created. - So options can be an incredibly useful investing tool, but what Bachelier saw on the trading floor was chaos, especially when it came to the price of stock options. Even though they had been around for hundreds of years, no one had found a good way to price them. Traders would just bargain to come to an agreement about what the price should be. - Given the option to buy or sell something in the future, it seems like a very amorphous kind of a trade. And so coming up with prices for these rather strange objects has been a challenge that's plagued a number of economists and business people for centuries. - Now, Bachelier, already interested in probability, thought there had to be a mathematical solution to this problem, and he proposed this as his PhD topic to his advisor Henri Poincar√©. Looking into the math of finance wasn't really something people did back then, but to Bachelier's surprise, Poincar√© agreed. To accurately price an option, first you need to know what happens to stock prices over time. The price of a stock is basically set by a tug of war between buyers and sellers. When more people wanna buy a stock, the price goes up. When more people wanna sell a stock, the price goes down. But the number of buyers and sellers can be influenced by almost anything, like the weather, politics, new competitors, innovation and so on. So Bachelier realized that it's virtually impossible to predict all these factors accurately. So the best you can do is assume that at any point in time the stock price is just as likely to go up as down and therefore over the long term, stock prices follow a random walk, moving up and down as if their next move is determined by the flip of a coin. - Randomness is a hallmark of an efficient market. By efficient economists typically"""

**Overall Summary:**
The video explores the profound impact of a single mathematical concept‚Äîthe random walk‚Äîon the world of finance, leading to the creation of multi-trillion dollar industries. It traces the history of quantitative finance from Isaac Newton's failed speculation to the pioneering work of Louis Bachelier, who first modeled stock prices as a random process, unknowingly predating Einstein's similar work on Brownian motion. The narrative highlights key innovators like Ed Thorp, who applied blackjack strategies to develop dynamic hedging, and culminates with the 1973 Black-Scholes-Merton equation. This formula provided a definitive method for pricing options, unleashing an explosion in derivatives trading. These instruments are shown to be double-edged swords, used by corporations for hedging risk and by traders for high-stakes leverage, as exemplified by the GameStop saga. Finally, the video examines the success of quantitative hedge funds like Jim Simons' Medallion Fund, which challenge the 'Efficient Market Hypothesis' by using advanced mathematics and machine learning to find and exploit hidden market patterns. The ultimate irony presented is that the work of these 'quants' in exploiting market inefficiencies simultaneously helps to eliminate them, pushing the financial world ever closer to the perfectly random model it was first imagined to be.

**Key Takeaways:**
‚Ä¢ Mathematical models, many originating from physics, have fundamentally transformed modern finance by providing a framework to price risk and complex financial instruments.
‚Ä¢ Options are versatile financial tools that allow investors to either hedge against potential losses or use leverage to amplify potential gains, but with correspondingly higher risk.
‚Ä¢ The Black-Scholes-Merton equation provided a standardized, universally accepted formula for pricing options, which catalyzed the creation of multi-trillion dollar derivative markets.
‚Ä¢ While financial markets are largely efficient and random, they are not perfectly so. Sophisticated quantitative analysis can uncover subtle patterns and inefficiencies, allowing skilled investors to consistently 'beat the market'.
‚Ä¢ The very act of exploiting market inefficiencies with mathematical models helps to eliminate those same inefficiencies, ironically pushing the market closer to a state of perfect randomness.
‚Ä¢ Derivatives have a dual nature: they can enhance market stability and liquidity during normal times but can also amplify risk and exacerbate crashes during periods of market stress.

**Key Facts:**
‚Ä¢ Jim Simons' Medallion Investment Fund returned 66% per year for 30 years.
‚Ä¢ A $100 investment in the Medallion Fund in 1988 would be worth $8.4 billion today.
‚Ä¢ In 1720, Isaac Newton lost approximately one-third of his wealth in the South Sea Company stock bubble.
‚Ä¢ The earliest known use of options was by Thales of Miletus around 600 BC.
‚Ä¢ Louis Bachelier proposed his mathematical theory of speculation for his PhD in 1900, five years before Einstein's paper on Brownian motion.
‚Ä¢ Ed Thorp's hedge fund achieved a 20% annual return for 20 consecutive years.
‚Ä¢ The Black-Scholes-Merton equation was published in 1973.
‚Ä¢ The global derivatives market is estimated to be on the order of several hundred trillion dollars.
‚Ä¢ During the 2021 short squeeze, GameStop shares rose approximately 700%.
‚Ä¢ Myron Scholes and Robert Merton were awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics in 1997 for their work on option pricing.

**Chapters:**
**Introduction: Quants vs. The Madness of People**
The video introduces the immense impact of a single mathematical equation on the financial world. It contrasts the extraordinary success of quantitative investors like mathematician Jim Simons with the historical failure of brilliant minds like Isaac Newton, who was undone by market psychology. This sets up the central theme: the quest to use mathematics to model and profit from the seemingly chaotic and unpredictable nature of financial markets.

**The Origins of Options and Bachelier's Insight**
This chapter explains the fundamental concept of financial options, tracing their origin back to ancient Greece. It defines call and put options using a modern example of Apple stock, highlighting their three main advantages: limited downside, leverage, and hedging. The narrative then introduces Louis Bachelier, who, while working at the Paris Stock Exchange, pioneered the use of mathematics to model financial markets, specifically focusing on the chaotic problem of how to price options.

**The Random Walk and Brownian Motion**
This section delves into Louis Bachelier's core idea: that stock prices follow a random walk. Using the analogy of a Galton board, it shows how numerous individual random paths create a predictable collective pattern‚Äîa normal distribution. This mathematical framework, which Bachelier called the 'radiation of probabilities', was a rediscovery of the heat equation. The chapter highlights a significant historical parallel, as Albert Einstein independently developed the same mathematics five years later to explain Brownian motion, thereby proving the existence of atoms.

**Bachelier's Pricing Model and Its Limitations**
The chapter explains how Bachelier used his random walk model to create a formula for pricing options. By calculating the probabilities of different price outcomes, he determined that a 'fair price' is one that equalizes the expected profit or loss for both the buyer and the seller. Although he had beaten Einstein to the mathematics of the random walk and solved a long-standing financial puzzle, his groundbreaking thesis went unnoticed for decades.

**From Blackjack to Wall Street: Ed Thorp's Innovations**
This chapter introduces Ed Thorp, who successfully transitioned from being a professional blackjack player (inventing card counting) to a highly successful hedge fund manager. He applied his understanding of odds and risk management to the stock market, pioneering the concept of dynamic hedging to create risk-neutral positions. Thorp also refined Bachelier's random walk model by adding a 'drift' component to account for underlying trends in stock prices, creating a more accurate option pricing formula which he used privately for his fund.

**The Black-Scholes-Merton Equation**
The video reaches its central topic: the Black-Scholes-Merton equation. In 1973, these economists developed a new and robust method for pricing options. Their crucial assumption was that a risk-free portfolio, constructed through dynamic hedging, must yield the same return as the safest available asset. This principle allowed them to derive a precise mathematical formula that relates an option's price to variables like the stock price, time, and interest rates. The equation was a revelation and was rapidly adopted by the financial industry, transforming it forever.

**The Impact and Scale of Derivatives**
This chapter explores the profound consequences of the Black-Scholes-Merton equation. It fueled the explosive growth of derivatives markets, now valued in the hundreds of trillions of dollars. The video explains the dual nature of these instruments: they allow corporations to hedge real-world risks, but they also provide immense leverage, as demonstrated by the GameStop phenomenon. While derivatives can enhance market stability by distributing risk, they also have the potential to amplify systemic shocks and contribute to major financial crises.

**Beating the Market: Jim Simons and Renaissance Technologies**
The narrative returns to Jim Simons, who represents the pinnacle of quantitative investing. After a distinguished career in mathematics, Simons applied his expertise in pattern recognition and code-breaking to financial markets. By hiring top scientists and leveraging computational power and vast amounts of data, his firm Renaissance Technologies sought to find non-random patterns that others missed. Their flagship Medallion Fund achieved unprecedented returns, serving as a powerful counterexample to the idea that the market is perfectly efficient and unbeatable.

**Conclusion: The Quest for an Efficient Market**
The video concludes by synthesizing its main themes. The work of physicists and mathematicians has provided deep insights into market dynamics, risk, and pricing. While the Efficient Market Hypothesis is a powerful model, evidence from funds like Medallion shows that inefficiencies and predictable patterns can be found and exploited. In a final, ironic twist, the very success of these quantitative strategies helps to correct the market's imperfections. As quants profit from patterns, they eliminate them, pushing the market ever closer to the ideal state of perfect, unpredictable randomness.
