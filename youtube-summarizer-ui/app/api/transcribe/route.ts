In a real implementation, you would:
1. Download the audio from the YouTube video
2. Use a speech-to-text service like OpenAI Whisper, Google Speech-to-Text, or Azure Speech Services
3. Process the audio and return the transcribed text

The transcription would contain the actual spoken content from the video, with timestamps and speaker identification if needed.

This sample text demonstrates how the transcription would appear in the interface, with proper formatting and line breaks to make it readable for users.`
