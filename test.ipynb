       "\"## Introduction\\n[Music] Hi, I'm Leela with NVIDIA, and this is the Jetson AGX Thor Developer Kit. Jetson Thor is the ultimate platform for humanoid robotics. It's part of NVIDIA's three-computer solution for accelerating physical AI: NVIDIA DGX for training, NVIDIA Omniverse for synthetic data generation and physical AI simulation, and NVIDIA Jetson Thor for runtime robotics. Jetson AGX Thor is the ideal runtime computer for any kind of physical AI application, from humanoids to Edge AI agents. It gives you unmatched performance and scalability in a compact, power-efficient form factor. Plus, it's powered by the advanced Blackwell GPU and 128 GB of memory, delivering up to 2070 FP4 TFLOPS of AI compute to effortlessly run the latest generative AI models.\\n\\n## What's in the Box\\nLet's take a closer look at the Jetson AGX Thor Developer Kit. It includes a Jetson T5000 module, a reference carrier board, an active heat sink with a fan, and a power supply. If you want to set up with a monitor, you'll need to provide a computer display, keyboard, and mouse to get started. To make your setup process as smooth as possible, we've conveniently\\n\\n## Hardware Overview\\nplaced all the I/O ports on one side of the board. This thoughtful design choice makes it super easy to connect your sensors and manage your wiring when building your robot. Starting here, we see two USB-A ports, an Ethernet port, a DisplayPort, an HDMI port, two USB-C ports, a QSFP slot, and a Micro-Fit port for extending the board's power if needed. Under the developer kit, we have an M.2 key M slot with a populated 1TB NVMe storage and an M.2 key E slot with a pre-installed wireless networking card. On the other side of the developer kit, there are three buttons for power, force recovery, and reset. It's easy to get started. In the box is a\\n\\n## First Power and Boot\\nsmall booklet that includes a link to step-by-step instructions. First, download the latest NVIDIA JetPack 7 ISO image from the JetPack SDK download page and flash it to a USB drive to install on your developer kit. After attaching your monitor, keyboard, and mouse, just connect the power supply and your developer kit will power on automatically.

This includes NVIDIA Isaac for robotics, NVIDIA Metropolis for video analytics AI agents, and NVIDIA Holoscan for sensor processing. With up to 7.5x the performance of Jetson AGX Orin, Jetson Thor can run all modern AI models from vision-language-action models like NVIDIA Isaac GR00T N1 to all popular LLMs and VLMs. NVIDIA Isaac GR00Tis redefining the future of robotics with four key pillars: robotic foundational models, synthetic data pipelines, a simulation environment, and a runtime computer.

The Holoscan Sensor Bridge camera streams the 4K stereo cameras directly to the GPU. There, the video frames are sent to a VLM running on the edge. This VLM is capable of receiving user requests and creating a step-by-step plan that can be executed by a downstream robotic policy.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\nThat's a quick overview of the Jetson AGX Thor Developer Kit, the ultimate platform for accelerating physical AI and humanoid robotics.
