I'm going to walk you through the five reasons to be bullish plus the exact entry point I may use to buy this stock. I'm not going to hold you hostage. The stock is Intel. You can now run away and you'll know nothing. But if you want to truly understand this company and the Wall Street rules for buying stocks like this, I've also made a detailed workbook for you that you can download at freedix.org/intel. It's completely free and it looks like this. Where is it? There it is in its full glory. And um you will not just get the interwork breakdown but also breakdown of the actual rules that Wall Street use is to pick stocks like this. Now, one of the reasons I spotted this is because Darkpool trading. So, the big boys on Wall Street, what are they buying? Has been bullish on Intel all week. So, here I'm looking at Monday. Got to move these cats out of the way. Uh, then we've got Tuesday. Casey was neutral, but that's still kind of okay. Uh, Wednesday, again, we were bullish up here. Uh, Thursday, bullish. and Friday once again bullish. So you add that all together you'd end up with a very very very bullish institutional buying spree for the week. So why is that? Well, first point and we've got five of these. The US government grants and and has basically given well the US government has given Intel some $7.8 billion to build its domestic chip foundaries. And yeah, some of that's still pending about 5 billion plus. But the goal here is to be like the key foundry in the US. And if you're not familiar with this whole space, someone like Nvidia does not have a foundry. They don't make their own chips, right? They outsource that to somebody else. So Intel could be that critical infrastructure that the US seeks to have. Second, under the new leadership, Intel is targeting $10 billion in cost savings. They aim to restore efficiency, profitability as they launch new, more competitive chips which are allegedly 50% cheaper to run than Nvidia's for the same inference output. And then you have well AI and PCs, right? So AI is doing something to the whole PC refresh cycle because people are starting to realize they need to buy more powerful machines to run all the new applications because a lot of compute power is required. And you're going to want to do a lot of that computing on your machine so you're not sending all your personal and private data back up to, you know, the lovely folks at OpenAI. You know what I'm saying? So AI capable PCs are going to be growing and Intel will take part of that. But really, and and this kind of ties into what I said just about government funding, the foundry business. So, Intel is investing tens of billions of dollars to build a foundry business that could rival TSMC, aiming to capture a share of that $80 billion third party foundry market as global customers seek alternatives to just Asia-based suppliers. So, you might actually end up with Intel making Nvidia chips. Could be crazy, hey, but it's possible. And then just pure valuation and pure potential returns. If Intel executes on the turnaround and goes back to historic profit margins, some analysts see a potential for a 3 to 5x return in the next couple of years, which would be pretty extraordinary. Now, there is always execution risk, but what I really want to look at with you is how do we actually time this? How why do we actually look at this? And yes, the fundamentals are important, but ultimately the key thing is to look at the chart. And why is that? Because what does the chart tell you? The chart tells you, it's also a great toy for kittens apparently. The chart tells you that where the money is going, right? That's what the chart actually says. So if a stock goes down, right, what does it mean? Money is leaving. And if a stock goes up, it tells you that money is coming, right? So, we want to be looking at things where the money is coming. It's pouring in. You can also see the news here on the side. This is all in trade vision. There's a link down below. It's part of our sort of super chart app here, which is tradevision.io, which which we built to give you guys and us the best news and the best data and everything else out there. But very interesting is that this stock has done absolutely nothing since now about September last year. So it's about a year that this stock has literally done nothing. And if you sort of draw a nice little box around that zone and that's genuinely helpful. You will see the zone in which the stock has been trading after it's collapsed. So what are we therefore looking for? We're looking for a breakout out of that zone. So yes, the last few days speculation the US might invest in Intel and so on. I hope they don't. I hope they just give them tax breaks. That will be much better because once government owns part of a business just becomes a freaking disaster because government can't run a bath, let alone a business. So what are we looking for? Well, we're looking to break out above these recent highs here. But what I do like is I like these long sideways consolidation periods because it means that people who wanted to sell are very likely already sold. There'll be very few bag holders in Intel after a year of going sideways. And we also see some pretty big volume here compared to what it usually did which also means a lot of trading a lot of ins and outs and all the people who wanted to get look at the historic volume. Historic volume is this right last 12 months even though stock hasn't done anything historic volume is significantly larger and a lot of that will be selling and we like selling in that moment because it creates a clean slate and therefore an opportunity for the stock to actually go up. So am I buying it here? No. And just like I didn't buy it early on unh or any of the other stocks that collapsed because the risk is great that what it's going to do is attract kittens to crawl over the keyboard. what it's going to do. It's going to hit the same highs again here. It's just going to go up and it's going to go back down and everyone will be crying. And we don't want that. We want to buy it when it breaks out on big volume. And um what we saw on Friday was big volume, right? A lot of volume. But the stock, well, it did close higher than the day before, but it did also come down during the day. So, it's not like the greatest setup in the world. We prefer a green candle or at least a gap up. We got neither. And then that little blue dotted line here shows you that after hours, no one's buying this thing either. So, what I've been watching out for, see the little line I just toggled on there for you? That's at $25. And what is that red little line I just toggled on there for you? You see this one here? It says res rather cryptically resistance. Resistance. And that tells you that market makers will likely sell at $25. So if you go on the say you go on a five minute chart in here and what you will see is the day starts here and every time we hit the $25 mark what happens big volume and why does that happen here again volume spikes selling volume it's the institutions selling right so again it's another tidbit of information that's just incredibly useful and that you can only get inside trade vision So maybe get yourself a trial to that if you wish. But to me, this is actually a beautiful setup, but for me, this still too early. So I'll be looking at this when it's trading up here at about exceeding that high, 2750. Uh I think the kittens are with me on that, aren't they? Naughty little monsters. There we are. There we go. These are the two who did all the research on this video. So, don't just run out and blindly buy stuff because some kittens told you to do it on YouTube. It would be silly. You need to have your own risk management. You need to have your stops set up. You need to know where to where where to do. The workbook will help you a lot with all of that. Um, if you just go to felix/inttel and download that. So, just don't buy stuff because everybody is excited about the latest thing. FOMO is never a good reason to buy something. There are lots of good reasons to buy lots of wonderful things. Um, so there we are. Now, do you think Rose did a good job of researching this? My little friendly gremlin. I if you did, share the video with a friend and um see you on the next one. This stock is about to blow up in my humble opinion just like MP Materials, which I covered on 28th of April and is now up well about 190%. On August 1st, I covered a very similar stock called USAR, same sector, and that's up some 37% in just a few days. And today I'm going to give you three more, plus even more bonus rare earth"
